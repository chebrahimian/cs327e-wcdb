HumanImpact:15,880 deaths,[22] 6,135 injured,[23] and 2,694 people missing[24] across twenty prefectures, as well as 129,225 buildings totally collapsed, with a further 254,204 buildings 'half collapsed', and another 691,766 buildings partially damaged.[25] The earthquake and tsunami also caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse.The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents.[29][30] Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors suffered explosionsdue to hydrogen gas that had built up within their outer containment buildings after cooling system failure.
EconomicImpact:Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion.[32] The Bank of Japan offered ¥15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions.[33] The World Bank's estimated economic cost was US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in world history.[34][35]

EconomicImpact:the Iranian government seriously considered moving the capital ofTehran in fear of an earthquake occurring there. Psychologically the earthquake had an impact on many of the victims for years afterwards. A new institutional framework in Iran was established to address problems of urban planning and to reconstruct the city of Bam in compliance with strict seismic regulations. This process marked a turning point, as government ministers and international organizations collaborated under this framework with local engineers and local people to organize the systematic rebuilding of the city.

Hurricane Katrina
Date:8/23/2005
Description:Hurricane Katrina was the deadliest and most destructive Atlantic hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the costliestnatural disaster, as well as one of the fivedeadliest hurricanes, in the history of the United States.[3] Among recorded Atlantic hurricanes, it was the sixth strongest overall. 
LocationID:
URLID:
HumanImpact:At least 1,833 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods,
EconomicImpact:total property damage was estimated at $81 billion (2005 USD) The economic effects of the storm were far-reaching. The Bush Administration sought $105 billion for repairs and reconstruction in the region,[79] which did not account for damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the oil supply, destruction of the Gulf Coast's highway infrastructure, and exports of commodities such as grain. Katrina damaged or destroyed 30 oil platforms and caused the closure of nine refineries;[39] the total shut-in oil production from the Gulf of Mexico in the six-month period following Katrina was approximately 24% of the annual production and the shut-in gas production for the same period was about 18%.[80] The forestry industry in Mississippi was also affected, as 1.3 million acres (5,300 km2) of forest lands were destroyed.[81] The total loss to the forestry industry from Katrina is calculated to rise to about $5 billion.[81] Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of local residents were left unemployed, which will have a trickle-down effect as fewer taxes are paid to local governments.

Description: were a series of four coordinatedterrorist attacks launched by the Islamistterrorist group al-Qaeda upon the United States in New York City and theWashington, D.C. 19 al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four passenger jets, intending to fly them in suicide attacksinto targeted buildings. Two of those planes,American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of theWorld Trade Center complex in New York City. Both towers collapsed within two hours and falling debris, combined with fires that the debris initiated in several surrounding buildings, led to the partial or complete collapse of all the other buildings in the World Trade Center complex, also causing major damage to ten other large structures in the immediate area of the complex. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon(the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense), leading to a partial collapse in its western side. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was targeted at the United States Capitol[2] in Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers.

Swine Flu
Date:4/?/2009
Description:First described in April 2009, the virus appeared to be a new strain of H1N1 which resulted when a previous triplereassortment of bird, swine and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus,[2] leading to the term "swine flu" to be used for this pandemic.[3] Unlike most strains of influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60 years; this was an unusual and characteristic feature of the H1N1pandemic.[4] Even in the case of previously very healthy persons, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms.[5][6] The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia

AMERICORPS
History: In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the National and Community Service Trust Act, which established the Corporation for National and Community Service and brought the full range of domestic community service programs under the umbrella of one central organization.
This legislation built on the first National Service Act signed by President H.W. Bush in 1990. It also formally launched AmeriCorps, a network of national service programs that engage Americans in intensive service to meet the nation’s critical needs in education, public safety, health, and the environment.
The newly created AmeriCorps incorporated two existing national service programs: the longstanding VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) program, created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC).

HURRICANE SANDY RELIEF FOUNDATION
History:The Hurricane Sandy Relief Foundation was founded  October 30, 2012  by the victims for the victims.
With widespread power outages and no heat the the Hurricane Sandy Relief Foundation worked tirelessly through the heart of the storm off a generator to build a website that would inform our fellow victims of local shelters and immediate relief.  Many of our friends, neighbors and relatives were devastated by the loss of homes, vehicles, clothes and food. We decided to take it upon ourselves to bring attention to our neighbors in need of immediate relief. With no funding, and limited resources we started our journey to raise donations to bring necessary supplies to local shelters, restore power, clean up debris, and rebuild communities. Thanks to our local board of directors we were able to secure enough funds to begin to make a difference. We are now receiving donations from across the country and thank all of you for your continued support. With an anticipated of 6-8 year recovery and 2 year clean up this will not be a sprint, it will be a marathon.

CDC
History:Descended from the wartime agency Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), the CDC initially focused on fighting malaria by killing mosquitoes.
Pursuit of malaria was by far the most absorbing interest of CDC during its early years, with over 50 percent of its personnel engaged in it.
Among its fewer than 400 original employees, the key jobs at CDC were those of entomologists and engineers. In fact, CDC had only seven medical officers on staff in 1946.
DDT, available since 1943, was its primary weapon, and the CDC′s early challenges included obtaining enough trucks, sprayers, and shovels necessary to wage the war on mosquitoes.
In its initial years, over 6.5 million homes were sprayed, and an early organization chart was even drawn—somewhat fancifully—in the shape of a mosquito.
CDC′s first budget was under $10 million.

History:FEMA was established under the 1978 Reorganization Plan No. 3, and activated April 1, 1979, by President Jimmy Carter in his Executive Order 12127.
In July, Carter signed Executive Order 12148 shifting disaster relief efforts to the new federal-level agency. FEMA absorbed the Federal Insurance Administration, the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration, the National Weather Service Community Preparedness Program, the Federal Preparedness Agency of the General Services Administration and the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration activities from HUD. FEMA was also given the responsibility for overseeing the nation's Civil Defense, a function which had previously been performed by the Department of Defense's Defense Civil Preparedness Agency.

WHO
History:In February 1946, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations helped draft the constitution of the new body.[2] The use of the word "world", rather than "international", emphasised the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve.[2] The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries of the United Nations by 22 July 1946. It thus became the first specialised agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed.[3] Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.[4] The first meeting of the World Health Assembly finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of US$5 million (then GBP£1,250,000) for the 1949 year. Andrija Stampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed Director-General of WHO, having served as Executive Secretary during the planning stages.[2] Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Its first legislative act was concerning the compilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease.[2] The logo of the World Health Organization features the Rod of Asclepius as a symbol for healing.[5]
